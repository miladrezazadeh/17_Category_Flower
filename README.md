This data set consists of colour images of flowers, each of which is categorized into one of 17 categories. 
In the modified version of the data set, the images have been scaled to be 50 x 50 pixels each, rather than their original dimensions.

The goal of this project is to build a neural network which will categorize a given flower image into its respective category.
