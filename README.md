This data set consists of colour images of flowers, each of which is categorized into one of 17 categories. 
In the modified version of the data set, the images have been scaled to be 50 x 50 pixels each, rather than their original dimensions.

Description from the authors:

"We have created a 17 category flower dataset with 80 images for each class. The flowers chosen are some common flowers in the UK. The images have large scale, pose and light variations and there are also classes with large variations of images within the class and close similarity to other classes".

The goal of this project is to build a neural network which will categorize a given flower image into its respective category.
